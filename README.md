# SSDfit
Fitting a species-sensitivity distribution and estimating error.  

See code for examples but also run:  
`library("shiny")`  
`runGitHub("SSDfit","eastandrew")`  
To see fake data run used in simulation to estimate HC5, LCL of HC5, and plot data, model, and CI+max/min.  


## Work in Progress!!
